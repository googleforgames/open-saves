# Development Guide

Triton is a service that platform agnostic cloud storage & save solution that
runs within [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

## Install Prerequisites

To build Triton you'll need the following applications installed.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  - On Windows, you need to make sure that the environment variable GOBIN is left undefined to work around an issue with building the gazelle tools. Otherwise you are going to get an error when trying to build/run `bazel run //:gazelle update` or `bazel build //:buildifier`
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) including the
  [post-install steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
- [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)
  - You can also use [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to manage Bazel installations.
  - Windows: Follow the instructions of [Installing Bazel on Windows](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html) and [Using rules_go on Windows](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/windows.rst) (installing msys2 and Visual Studio, setting appropriate envrionment variables, etc).
- A working C/C++ toolchain
  - Windows, we use [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) for development

Optional Software

- [Google Cloud Platform](cloud.google.com)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or
  Hyperkit[https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/hyperkit/] for
  [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

_It's recommended that you install Go using their instructions because package
managers tend to lag behind the latest Go releases._

## Get the Code

```bash
# Create a directory for the project.
mkdir -p $HOME/workspace
cd $HOME/workspace
# Download the source code.
git clone https://github.com/googleforgames/triton.git
cd triton
```

_Typically for contributing you'll want to
[create a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and use that
but for purpose of this guide we'll be using the upstream/master._

## Building

To build everything, simply run

```bash
bazel build ...
```

from command line. Bazel will download necessary toolchains and libraries and build binaries. Ouput binaries will be placed under the `bazel-bin/` directory. Please reference [Output directory layout](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/output_directories.html) of the Bazel document to learn more about the directory structure.

To build a single target, run `bazel build //<module>:<target>`.

### Updating Go build dependencies

Go dependencies in Bazel are managed by [Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle). If you have changes in dependencies (i.e. adding a new source file), run

```bash
bazel run //:gazelle update
```

in the workspace root directory to update Bazel BUILD files.

### Updating Go modules

We use Go Modules to manager external dependencies. In order to reflect changes in the `go.mod` file to Bazel BUILD files, run

```bash
bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=repositories.bzl%go_repositories
```

in the workspace root directory.

### Running simple gRPC server/client

To stand up the gRPC server, there's a lightweight wrapper around the server code that lives in `cmd/main.go`. To start this, run

```bash
bazel run //cmd:cmd
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
$ bazel run cmd:cmd
INFO: Analyzed target //cmd:cmd (5 packages loaded, 251 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //cmd:cmd up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/cmd/darwin_amd64_stripped/cmd
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.076s, Critical Path: 0.81s
INFO: 1 process: 1 darwin-sandbox.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 3 total actions
INFO: Build completed successfully, 3 total actions
INFO[0000] starting server on tcp :6000
```

To test the server is actually running, there is a sample gRPC client usage in `examples/grpc-client/main.go`. While the server is running, run

```bash
bazel run //examples/grpc-client:grpc-client
```

## Deploying to Kubernetes

TODO

## IDE Support

Triton is a standard Go project so any IDE that understands that should
work. We use [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) which is a
relatively new feature in Go so make sure the IDE you are using was built around
Summer 2019. The latest version of
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) supports it.
